# My Custom `prezto`

I maintain this separately from my other
[dotfiles](https://github.com/srsudar/dotfiles). For the most part, these
should be installed by by cloning this repo and following the "Installation"
section below. A few things to note, however, that I always mess up:
* Follow the instructions exactly. All of them, including launching `zsh` to
    begin.
    * **For real**. They are specific, and invariably I try to copy them and
        get a stupid naming convention wrong, like the annoying `prezto` to
        `.zprezto` directory name, and mess something up. Just copy them, with
        the exception pointed out below.
    * **Except**: clone my own repo, not sorin-ionescu's as shown in the clone
        URL. Depending on my terminal (iTerm2, Ubuntu's), `chsh` might not be
        enough, so you might also have to do whatever the terminal of choice
        requires.
* See the next section on machine-specific configuration.

## Machine-Specific Configuration

I have added a convention for machine-specific configuration that doesn't
exist, so far as I know, in the original Prezto project. Alongside the
`runcoms/` directory, I've added a `machine-specific/` directory. Config
specific to certain machines (e.g. `/usr/local/Cellar/` on a Mac) belongs in
files in that directory.

In order to source those files appropriately, I've also taken to assigning each
machine a name. E.g. my Macbook Air is `mbair`. The existence of a file
`~/.zshMachineFlag_machineName` indicates the current machine. Adding a line
like this to `runcoms/zshrc` ensures that we source the file appropriately:

```
if [[ -a ~/.zshMachineFlag_mbair ]]; then
  source "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/machine-specific/mbair_zshrc
fi
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

Configuration that varies across platform (e.g. standard `ls` versions), is
configured in `.zprezto/machine-specific/<platform>_zshrc`, with platform named
according to the output of `uname -s` and converted to lower case. These files
are sourced before machine-specific files to try allow more specific overrides.

## Setting up Prezto

### First-time Setup

Here are the steps to set this up for the first time:
* Determine a machine name. For this example we'll say it's foo.
* If custom configuration is required, add it to `machine-specific/foo_zshrc`.
* Execute `touch ~/.zshMachineFlag_foo`.
* Add these lines to `runcoms/zshrc`:
```
if [[ -a ~/.zshMachineFlag_foo ]]; then
  source "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/machine-specific/mbair_foo
fi
```

### Repeat Setup
In this case we don't need to worry about editing the files. Just:
* `touch ~/.zshMachineFlag_foo`


## Selective `vcs_info`

`vcs_info` allows for integration of version control systems with your prompt.
This can be slow, however, depending on the options you're supporting.
`check-for-changes` in particular can be slow on big `git` repos like Chromium,
e.g. To get around this, I've added a function based on [this
method](https://github.com/johan/zsh/blob/master/Misc/vcs_info-examples#L88-L102)
that allows selective disabling of `check-for-changes` on a machine-specific
basis.

In order to indicate that you do not want `check-for-changes` to be true, add
an element to the `ZSHMS_VCSINFO_NO_CHECK_CHANGES` array with the absolute path
to the directory you want ignored. See `machine-specific/mbair_zshrc` for an
example. This variable is then looked for in the prompt command to selectively
enable or disable `check-for-changes`.

Prezto â€” Instantly Awesome Zsh
==============================

Prezto is the configuration framework for [Zsh][1]; it enriches the command line
interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,
and prompt themes.

Installation
------------

Prezto will work with any recent release of Zsh, but the minimum required
version is 4.3.17.

  1. Launch Zsh:

        zsh

  2. Clone the repository:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"

  3. Create a new Zsh configuration by copying the Zsh configuration files
     provided:

        setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
        for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N); do
          ln -s "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
        done

  4. Set Zsh as your default shell:

        chsh -s /bin/zsh

  5. Open a new Zsh terminal window or tab.

### Troubleshooting

If you are not able to find certain commands after switching to *Prezto*,
modify the `PATH` variable in *~/.zprofile* then open a new Zsh terminal
window or tab.

Updating
--------

Pull the latest changes and update submodules.

    git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive

Usage
-----

Prezto has many features disabled by default. Read the source code and
accompanying README files to learn of what is available.

### Modules

  1. Browse */modules* to see what is available.
  2. Load the modules you need in *~/.zpreztorc* then open a new Zsh terminal
     window or tab.

### Themes

  1. For a list of themes, type `prompt -l`.
  2. To preview a theme, type `prompt -p name`.
  3. Load the theme you like in *~/.zpreztorc* then open a new Zsh terminal
     window or tab.

Customization
-------------

The project is managed via [Git][3]. It is highly recommended that you fork this
project; so, that you can commit your changes and push them to [GitHub][4] to
not lose them. If you do not know how to use Git, follow this [tutorial][5] and
bookmark this [reference][6].

Resources
---------

The [Zsh Reference Card][7] and the [zsh-lovers][8] man page are indispensable.
