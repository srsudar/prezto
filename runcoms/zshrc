# Stop confirming history expansions. I.e. (as without an ie I'm never, ever
# going to remember what this actually does), with the power of expansion,
# !$ means the last word of the previous command. E.g.
# touch newfile
# chmod a+x !$
# means create that file and run the command `chmod a+x newfile`. However, with
# history confirmation, hitting enter actually expands this to
# `chmod a+x newfile` on a new prompt rather than just performing the 
# substitution and running it, like all other commands do. Annoying. So, change
# this. <TAB> will still perform it inline.
